# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added a `dshmux.dshPath` setting for running a custom DSH executable, including a built CLI from a patched source checkout.
- Fixed zoomed embedded content overflowing the viewport and breaking the sticky chat composer.
- Renamed the project, extension identity, views, commands, and settings to **DSHmux** (`matik5.dshmux`; repository `matik5/DSHmux`). Legacy `deepseekHarness.*` setting values remain readable for compatibility.
- Renamed the primary side view to **DSHmux Chat** and reveal it automatically after VS Code or the extension host restarts.
- Added an immediate dimmed loading overlay and progress bar while switching the side-panel chat to another DSH session.
- Fixed Web Audio cues in suspended Chromium webviews, added `turn/end`, `question/requested`, and `approval/requested` (elevation/permission prompt) protocol fallbacks, and prevented duplicate fallback sounds.
- Added a `dshmux.frameFontScale` setting (default `0.9`, range 0.5–1.5) that zooms the embedded side-panel DSH frame; the editor-tab view keeps the upstream size.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- **Sidebar status frozen on "Starting…"** — after switching the sidebar (e.g. file tree ↔ DeepSeek Harness) or waking the laptop, the sidebar status could stay on the blinking "Starting…" state even though the service was ready and the session list refreshed normally. The status message was sent before the sidebar page finished loading and got dropped. The page now signals when it is ready to receive updates, and the extension re-pushes the current status then.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed
- **"Failed to load plugins" with dsh 0.1.1-rc.2** — upgrading dsh to 0.1.1-rc.2 broke the embedded panel again: the boot manifest changed its injection from `window.__DSH_BOOT__` to `globalThis["__DSH_BOOT__"]`, so plugin bundle URLs were no longer rewritten to the server and the webview could not load them ("bundle script /plugins/... failed to load"). Both boot shapes are now recognized.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed
- **"Failed to load plugins" error in the embedded panel** — the panel could show *"Failed to load plugins / HTML did not preload @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-modules/client.js"* when using newer dsh versions (rc.8+). The panel now loads plugins correctly.
- **A browser tab no longer opens on its own** — starting the extension could automatically open your default browser to the DeepSeek Harness UI. That's now suppressed; the UI stays embedded in VS Code. (Use the "Open in Browser" command if you ever want it in a browser.)
- **Prerelease upgrade hints now appear** — if a newer prerelease (e.g. rc.8) of dsh is available, the sidebar shows the upgrade hint as expected instead of silently hiding it.
- **No more error when closing VS Code** — closing or reloading the window could log a "DisposableStore" error to the console. That's gone.

### Added
- **Extension version shown in the sidebar** — the launcher header now displays `extension v0.3.1` under the DeepSeek Harness title, so you can always tell which extension version you're running.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- **Dual-channel upgrade hints** — the sidebar now tracks both npm channels: a **latest** button and a **next** (prerelease) button appear independently when a newer version exists on that channel (e.g. `latest 0.1.0-rc.7` + `next 0.1.0-rc.8`); each opens a QuickPick with the matching `@latest` / `@next` command (prefilled into a terminal, never auto-run).
- **`--no-open` browser suppression** — dsh 0.1.0-rc.8+ opens the default browser on `dsh web` by default; the extension now passes `--no-open` (version-gated, so older CLIs that reject the flag are unaffected) to keep the embedded UI browser-free.

### Fixed
- Session list stayed empty when the launcher sidebar was opened while dsh was **already running** (polling only started on a state transition). It now polls immediately at view open.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **Session manager** in the sidebar — lists all active sessions with title, relative activity time (`5m`/`3h`/`2d`), inline rename (`✎`), and archive (`✕`); an expandable **Archived** section shows archived sessions with titles; blank sessions appear as "New Session" rows. Refreshes every 5s (server-state aware, re-entry guarded).
- **Multi-panel sessions** — `＋New session` opens a fresh editor panel bound to a new session; clicking a listed session opens/focuses its panel; panels **stack over the current tab group** (no more tiled narrow views).
- **Archive closes the panel** — archiving a session also closes its open panel; the default panel is bound to the IDE workspace session so it can be closed too.
- **Reload restores every open panel** — the dist-tree cache download is guarded against concurrent access, so restoring several panels at once never produces blank panels.
- UI strings for the new features across all 9 languages.

### Fixed
- Blank sessions no longer accumulate on every start — existing ones are reused.
- macOS realpath mismatch (`/var/folders` vs `/private/var/folders`) no longer breaks workspace matching.

### Changed
- Removed the redundant "Open View" button from the sidebar launcher (the command and status-bar entry remain).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Workspace alignment** — the DSH workspace anchor now follows the IDE workspace (feature M1):
  - Switching folders closes stale panels and starts cold; reloading the *same* workspace auto-restarts dsh and restores the panel.
  - The embedded UI shows the **current IDE workspace** (not the most recently active one) via a session preset injected before the DSH frontend boots.
  - Clicking the activity-bar icon auto-starts dsh when it is not running.
- **dsh version soft-check + upgrade helper** — the sidebar shows "Update available: x.y.z →" when a newer dsh exists; clicking offers an upgrade command matched to your install method (npx cache / npm global / nvm) in a QuickPick, prefilled into an integrated terminal (never auto-run). Checks are gated to once per 24h and offline-safe.
- **Sidebar refinements** — full-width buttons (Stop above Open View), two-line status (version + URL), removed the subtitle.
- UI strings for the new features across all 9 languages.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- Extension UI translations: Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, French and German (9 languages total; follows the VS Code display language).

## [0.0.9] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- Cross-platform dsh process termination: on Windows, kill the full process tree (`taskkill /T /F`) so the `cmd.exe` wrapper no longer orphans the `node` child.
- Unit-test portability: platform-agnostic path assertions and a Windows-compatible fake `dsh` shim.

### Changed
- CI smoke step now has a 15-minute timeout.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- Cross-platform CI matrix (macOS, Ubuntu, Windows) with a real `dsh` spawn smoke test.
- README badges (CI, Open VSX version/downloads, Marketplace link).

### Fixed
- Windows binary resolution (`dsh.cmd`, `%LocalAppData%\npm-cache` layout) and `shell: true` spawn.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- Pointed `repository` at the renamed GitHub repo.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- Renamed the display name to "DeepSeek Harness Web for VS Code" (VS Code Marketplace display names are globally unique).

## [0.0.5] - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- Renamed the extension id to `deepseek-harness-web-for-vscode` (VS Code Marketplace extension names are globally unique).

## [0.0.4] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- DeepSeek tab icon on the editor-tab webview.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- Central bilingual (en/zh) string table; the UI follows the VS Code language.
- English-only marketplace description.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- Bundled the runtime `ws` dependency into the vsix (activation crashed without it on a fresh install).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- Initial MVP: spawn `dsh web`, transport bridge (fetch/WebSocket/clipboard), editor-tab webview, sidebar launcher, status bar, theme sync, and packaging.
